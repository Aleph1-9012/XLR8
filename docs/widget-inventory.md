# Widget inventory

The library contains 43 published entries: six Quick notes, five Players, eleven Glyphs, eight Interactive art widgets, nine Lockscreens, and four Sliders. All have native QML exports and are included in production builds. Lockscreens export visual components and demo interactions; they do not implement authentication or desktop session locking. Sliders expose a percentage value and user-change signal for a host model. This file is the one place these counts are recorded; `make check` prints the current totals. Each distinct design has its own catalog entry, preview document, thumbnail, and settings. Palettes and other appearance controls remain settings. Archive paths identify source provenance; the original archive is not required to build this repository.

| Source page | Individual widgets |
| --- | --- |
| `tsugumori-five-glyph-studies.html` | [Recursive relays](../widgets/glyphs/recursive-relays/README.md), [Branch grammar](../widgets/glyphs/branch-grammar/README.md), [Shifted script](../widgets/glyphs/shifted-script/README.md), [Oblique ligatures](../widgets/glyphs/oblique-ligatures/README.md), [Radical exchange](../widgets/glyphs/radical-exchange/README.md) |

The existing entries remain available:

- [Phase lock](../widgets/lockscreens/phase-lock/formation/README.md)
- [Glyph Bay typing](../widgets/glyphs/glyph-bay-typing/README.md)

Open a design with `/?widget=<widget-id>`. Each widget has its own in-memory state. Leaving a preview resets it.

## Native families

All six families have native QML exports. Each family's components, shared files, and inspection notes are in its category folder: [Quick notes](../widgets/quick-notes/README.md), [Player](../widgets/player/README.md), [Glyphs](../widgets/glyphs/README.md), [Interactive art](../widgets/interactive-art/README.md), [Lockscreens](../widgets/lockscreens/README.md), and [Sliders](../widgets/sliders/README.md).

## Interactive art addition

[Fish murmuration](../widgets/interactive-art/fish-murmuration/README.md) draws its fish animation in shared browser and Qt code, manually matched to the video in [Ramin Nasibov's post](https://x.com/RaminNasibov/status/2116201987146383447). Pointer movement parts the school. It is published as `interactive-art-fish-murmuration` with adjustable speed and native QML export. Its 0BSD implementation license excludes the private reference footage, which is not packaged.

## Sliders additions

The owner supplied these retained designs in `Lib-assests/chaldea assets/`. Each became a separate widget with matching browser and native controls. Import removed the surrounding visualization wrapper, persistence bridge, unused variants, and remote helper scripts.

| Source page | Widget |
| --- | --- |
| `comb.html` | [Comb](../widgets/sliders/comb/README.md) |
| `slats.html` | [Slats](../widgets/sliders/slats/README.md) |
| `stipple-blade.html` | [Stipple Blade](../widgets/sliders/stipple-blade/README.md) |
| `weave.html` | [Weave](../widgets/sliders/weave/README.md) |

## Archive import

The library retains 24 entries from the archive import alongside the 14 earlier designs. All 125 HTML files are accounted for in [the import manifest](archive-imports.json), including excluded categories, duplicates, and palette companions. Auxiliary images, PDFs, and helper scripts remain references. The archive is unchanged.

The import manifest records excluded sources and designs, consolidated lockscreen variants, and palette companions.

Punch record, Shutter bank, Formation field, Stencil assembly, and Typesetter belong to Glyphs and now have native exports. They retain artwork and input in the Glyph preview host, with lockscreen clocks, power actions, and surrounding layouts removed. Their IDs and settings keys are unchanged.

Lockscreens retain one entry per layout; artwork and motion variations share that representative. [The lockscreen guide](../widgets/lockscreens/README.md) lists the retained previews and their selected artwork. Only the entries listed below are available in the catalog.

| Category | Widgets |
| --- | ---: |
| Glyphs | 11 |
| Interactive art | 8 |
| Lockscreens | 9 |
| Player | 5 |
| Quick notes | 6 |
| Sliders | 4 |
