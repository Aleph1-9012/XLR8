# Development and verification

Run commands from the repository root. `make -f /absolute/path/to/Chaldea/Makefile <target>` also works.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `make setup` | Check pinned Rust/Bun versions and install frozen frontend dependencies |
| `make dev` | Rebuild all local widgets, including drafts, and serve port 5175 |
| `make content` | Rebuild local content after editing widget sources |
| `make check` | Run units and code checks, package local and production content, and validate every widget |
| `make test` | Rerun only the small Rust and Bun unit suites |
| `make build` | Build production output in `dist/`, excluding drafts |
| `make preview` | Serve the production output on port 4173 |

Open `/` for the Svelte site or `/?page=library` for the catalog. This is the only frontend in development and production. The old vanilla frontend has been removed; `?workbench` bookmarks redirect within the same page to the library or selected widget. Site code lives in `frontend/src/site/`; the catalog client, generator, settings validator, and preview protocol keep their existing paths.

The Rust backend runs during `make content`, `make dev`, and `make build`. It produces `catalog.json` and versioned bundles, which the Svelte site loads through `frontend/src/catalog/load.ts`. Development serves `build/content/`; production serves the published revisions copied into `dist/`. No separate runtime API process is needed.

The dark initial background and keyboard skip-link styles live in `frontend/index.html` so they apply before JavaScript loads the site's stylesheet. Keep them in the HTML to prevent a white flash and an unstyled "Skip to content" link during refresh. The link appears when focused from the keyboard.

Production builds use `frontend/scripts/build-site.ts` to render the existing Svelte homepage into HTML before building the browser app. The temporary renderer stays outside the published output. The page embeds the validated production catalog so startup can keep the static homepage visible until fonts settle, then mount with the same widget counts. Development and retry flows still fetch the catalog. Without JavaScript, the homepage and its family links remain readable; interactive library filters, previews, and exports require JavaScript. The `noscript` style keeps the hero artwork visible without its animation action.

`site/metadata.ts` owns titles, descriptions, canonical URLs, and WebSite structured data. Query-based routes share the initial HTML, so canonical tags are added after the catalog is available, avoiding a homepage canonical on every widget. Missing and draft widgets receive `noindex`; pending catalog requests do not. Library filters canonicalize to the unfiltered library. Vite generates `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` from the published catalog. Neither file lists draft widgets or immutable revision files. After deploying these changes, follow [search discovery](publishing.md#search-discovery) to submit the sitemap and inspect indexing.

The outer page scrollbar is hidden in `site/site.css` while wheel, touch, keyboard, and Back to top scrolling remain available. This rule applies only to the document; customization panels and generated code retain their own scrollbars.

The library supports A–Z and Family sorting. `sort=family` selects Family; missing or unsupported sort values use A–Z.

There are no scope flags, per-widget test modes, browser test installations, fish simulations, or native test matrices. The former suites are available in Git history if a past investigation needs them.

## What the checks cover

`make test` exercises shared behavior with small synthetic fixtures: settings boundaries and typed QML placeholders, escaping and immutable generated results, complete assets, draft export restrictions, preview messages and runtime generation, folder discovery and the local source index, revisions, path confinement, publication ownership, draft omission, and preservation of existing output after a staging failure. Shared Rust/TypeScript contract cases live in `schemas/fixtures/`; they verify that both implementations agree. Generator tests cover boundary values for all five setting types without repeating them for every widget.

`make check` runs those units, Rust formatting and Clippy, a local content build, and one production build. Svelte diagnostics and TypeScript checking run during the production build. Rust is the only reader of widget sources and validates the entire library each time it packages. It writes `build/content/source-index.json` with the discovered IDs, source folders, and thumbnail mappings. The frontend library validator checks that the index and local catalog contain the same widgets, then inspects every packaged revision and checks:

- Classic preview JavaScript syntax without executing it, the shared runtime reference, and literal HTML `src`, `href`, `poster`, and CSS `url(...)` asset references.
- Valid setting definitions and defaults for every widget.
- One complete native export check per widget, using its default settings. The output must contain every declared file and preserve packaged asset bytes. Shared unit tests cover serialization and settings boundaries; the library scan checks each widget's templates and assets.
- Production notices, bundle identities, thumbnails, export assets, and the exact published widget set. Each production revision must equal the one checked locally. Draft files and the local source index must not appear in `dist/`.
- The SIL Open Font licenses for the site's self-hosted Faculty Glyphic and JetBrains Mono files, emitted under `dist/licenses/` by Vite.
- Homepage text and library links in the built HTML, its referenced assets, the no-JavaScript artwork fallback, and sitemap membership matching the published catalog.

The library validator has no widget-ID list to update. Add a valid `widget.json` in any supported category/study folder and it is checked on the next run. Errors identify the source folder or file. Unit tests remain independent of library size; the library scan grows with the files being checked.

These are static and data checks. They do not claim to verify visible layouts, clicks, animation quality, browser clipboard behavior, QML rendering, or desktop integrations. Inspect a changed preview at desktop and narrow widths in `make dev`, try its controls and export, and check native changes in an isolated Quickshell configuration before publishing them.

## CI and deployment builds

CI runs `make setup` followed by the same `make check`, then saves `dist/` as the `chaldea-site` artifact for 14 days. Pull requests and pushes to `main` are checked; ordinary branch pushes do not launch a second copy of a pull-request run. A newer run cancels a superseded run for the same ref. No browser is downloaded or launched.

Local and production content are separate. `build/content/` always holds every widget, drafts included, and its source index; `build/production/` holds the published set that Vite copies into `dist/`. The source index never enters production bundles or revision hashes. A running `make dev` keeps its drafts through a check. Do not run `make build` again after a successful check unless sources have changed.

Vercel hosts the public site through its Git integration. Pushes to `main` run `scripts/build-vercel.sh`, which installs the pinned tools and runs `make setup` and `make check` before assembling the deployment. GitHub Actions continues checking pull requests and `main` independently. No GitHub deployment token is needed. Follow [publishing.md](publishing.md) for setup, verification, and rollback. Website updates do not require a release or package version change.

## Setup and stale output

Use the versions in `rust-toolchain.toml` and `.bun-version`. Make keeps Cargo and Bun caches under ignored `build/`. Dependency changes require an intentional `bun install` and review of `frontend/bun.lock`; normal installs use `bun install --frozen-lockfile`. Keep `backend/Cargo.lock` current too.

Never edit generated files under `build/` or `dist/`. Fix their sources and rebuild. Widget changes need `make content` and a reload; Vite watches application code but does not rebuild Rust content. The config is `chaldea.toml`. The packager writes a `.chaldea-content` ownership marker into its output. It refuses to overwrite a directory without that exact marker; inspect the path rather than adding a marker to bypass that protection. Output from before the project was renamed carries an older marker: delete that `build/` directory and rebuild.

## Fix a library error

Check the reported widget's `widget.json` first. IDs must be unique across the library. Each public/export file must exist inside its widget folder or the `_shared/` folder of a parent group, and mappings cannot overlap or use reserved paths. A `not found in this widget or a parent _shared folder` error names the widget folder and the declared source. New category and study folders cannot be empty or symlinked; a group holding only `_shared/` counts as empty. Moving source folders keeps the ID and URL; changing declared source bytes creates a new revision. Editing a file under `_shared/` gives every widget that uses it a new revision; a widget's own copy at the same path takes precedence.

A preview must load `../preview-runtime.js` from its HTML entry and register `window.ChaldeaPreview.connect`. Use classic scripts and declared local assets. Do not add `allow-same-origin` to work around a sandbox failure. The static checker resolves literal references; dynamically computed assets and behavior still need a manual preview check.

The shared preview runtime is generated from `frontend/src/preview/runtime-source.js` and `schemas/preview-host.schema.json`. After changing either, run `bun scripts/build-preview-runtime.ts` inside `frontend/`, then `make content`. Commit the generated `frontend/src/preview/runtime.js` with its sources. Unit checks reject stale generated bytes. `schemas/preview-controls.schema.json` defines the bounded control snapshots accepted by the sidebar. Try actions and appearance settings together when changing this protocol; actions must preserve the running scene and stay out of exported settings.

Quick Notes previews declare their preferred frame width with `data-preview-width` on the body, including outer padding. The runtime sends it with height updates, including width-only changes. The host bounds that width and lets the layout shrink on narrow screens. Settings that change widget width must update the body attribute too.

Template placeholders must be complete typed property values. Every native setting needs a binding. Published widgets require QML, nonempty exported instructions, and an exported license. An HTML-only design remains a draft with downloads disabled.

If the browser shows an old or removed widget, rebuild local content and reload. A widget load error's Try again button also revalidates the catalog and loads the current revision. Removed widget sources remain in Git history; original import provenance is recorded in `docs/archive-imports.json`.

## Manual export inspection

The public site's Save file button saves only the selected output, including binary assets. Copy is available for text files. Save every listed file, including README.md and LICENSE, and preserve its displayed path in your widget folder. Browsers download the final file name only; create any listed subfolders yourself. Invalid settings disable both actions until corrected.

To create exact generated files without a browser, run this inside `frontend/`:

```sh
bun run export <widget-id> <new-output-directory> [settings.json]
```

The destination must not exist. Keep every file from the export together. Use Qt 6 tools to inspect native QML, and load the exported `shell.qml` in a separate test configuration rather than modifying live desktop files. Record the revision, environment, and limits when claiming native support.

Thumbnail capture still uses Playwright as an authoring tool through `scripts/thumbnails.ts`; it is not part of either check command. Browser binaries are only needed if you explicitly use that tool. Run `make content` after moving a widget or changing its thumbnail mapping so the local source index is current. From `frontend/`, `bun scripts/thumbnails.ts <preview-base-url> [widget-id-or-path ...]` accepts IDs and paths under `widgets/`, including an optional `widgets/` prefix. With no selectors it refreshes every local raster thumbnail and preserves authored SVG thumbnails. Raster capture requires a declared WebP source and writes that source path inside the widget folder, even if the current file comes from `_shared/`. Selecting only SVG thumbnails does not launch a browser. The writer checks filesystem metadata and rejects symlinked destination folders or files before creating directories or writing bytes. Run `make content` again to package the new image.

Blurry library cards usually indicate old 640 × 400 captures. The capture script now uses the card proportions from `frontend/src/site/catalog.ts`, waits for fonts and canvas rendering, and saves quality-95 WebP images at roughly 1320 or 2000 pixels wide. Tall lockscreen pages are fitted into the capture area so their login and footer remain visible. Regenerate the affected thumbnails and run `make content`; increasing an existing image's CSS size cannot restore its detail.

For an off-center capture or unwanted demo controls, inspect the widget's `frames` entry in `scripts/thumbnails.ts`. Console uses its notes section with 20 pixels of padding. Phase Lock uses its artwork section at a 1024-pixel viewport width so the full background and corner details fit the card. Fish murmuration centers its 360 × 477 canvas with 64 pixels of padding and a matching black background, avoiding a separate portrait strip inside its landscape card. The capture expands around the selected element to match the card ratio, preserving the complete widget. Keep these adjustments in the capture script rather than changing the live preview's layout.

Branch Grammar, Oblique Ligatures, and Radical Exchange frame their complete glyph and input panel, so the bottom controls fit the library thumbnail. Their live canvases resize with the preview to keep the line work sharp. Branch Grammar and Oblique Ligatures use at least three pixels per CSS pixel for their nested detail; Radical Exchange uses at least two.

Interactive art thumbnails acknowledge the preview's external controls during startup, then frame the complete canvas and center it within the card proportions. This excludes standalone buttons, duplicate titles, and gesture instructions. Embedded artwork uses the same view, with actions in the customization sidebar and instructions retained in canvas accessibility labels. Widget detail pages omit the generic instruction paragraph below the preview.

Preview frames stay invisible until their first authenticated settings render completes. The existing block loader covers the preview until that render finishes, then stops; a timeout or preview error replaces it with the thumbnail and error message. Bundle loading uses the same loader. Neither stage adds a minimum wait, and later customization updates keep the preview visible. The runtime publishes sidebar controls before its ready message, so the host acknowledges those controls before sending initial settings. This prevents standalone demo labels flashing during startup without a timed delay. Retained lockscreen documents contain only their fixed design; the archive toolbar, layout description, and leftover “Glyph” label are removed from the source.

Live widget detail pages lay out their interactive content directly, without thumbnail proportions or iframe scaling. Most previews can grow up to 1200 pixels wide. Most Interactive art previews fill the preview column without outer padding or the standalone artwork frame, and their canvas height sets the panel height. Authenticated body-height messages resize the host, including Magnetic powder's Compact canvas setting. If a preview is clipped after a settings change, check that it sends an updated `resize` message; do not restore a fixed stage height or shrink the iframe. Compact widgets can report a preferred width, which is capped by the available space on mobile.

Fish murmuration and Sea turtle use a compact workbench capped at 1280 pixels, with the site's ink playback button, paper action button, and numeric value labels. The turtle's Cream and White choices use native radio controls styled as segmented buttons. Sea turtle reports a 640-pixel preferred preview width, with a 640 × 400 desktop canvas and a 300-pixel minimum height on narrow screens. Fish murmuration reports its existing 360-pixel width. Their preview hosts cap these requested widths to the available space, including inside the art layout. Pointer presses focus the canvas without selecting it or showing a focus box on the surrounding iframe; keyboard focus remains visible inside the artwork.

The unfiltered A–Z library uses masonry placement and individual card proportions. Family filters, search results, and Family sorting use rows in the selected order, with each row starting at the left. Every card uses one column, and cards in the same family have equal dimensions. Family plate ratios live in `site/catalog.ts`: Glyphs 7:10, Art and Player 8:5, Lockscreens 1:1, Notes 9:10, and Sliders 3:1. Art and Player filters use fewer, wider columns. Thumbnails fit inside their plates without additional cropping. Position, width, and plate proportions transition together when filters change. Card layout is contained, and plates use `content-visibility: auto` so the browser can skip offscreen rendering while keeping the full-resolution thumbnails.

The production homepage starts with static content and its embedded catalog while the two preloaded typefaces settle. Development holds the green poster background while fetching the catalog. Failed font requests still allow fallback text; catalog errors retain the retry view. The hero count and WIDGETS masthead start clipped in their markup until `site/hero-liquid.ts` installs their curved liquid fill. The count fills from bottom to top with staggered digits; the masthead fills from top to bottom with one continuous wave across its visible crop. Both keep their artwork at its original size and position throughout the reveal. Temporary SVG clips adapt to the artwork's dimensions and are removed when the reveal finishes. Reduced motion, a hidden tab, or navigation ends the animation immediately; no animation work continues at rest. Menu and library numerals keep their existing rendering.

The homepage family menu follows Chaldea-Final's directory layout. Hovering or focusing a row selects its panel; row and Open links navigate to the matching library filter. Counts, inventories, and thumbnail URLs come from the current catalog. Below 851px it becomes an accessible stack of folders with one expanded family at a time. The Home v2 phone hero uses the paper label, full-width actions, and cropped catalog count. Its navigation includes Changelog. The original poster wall, its decorative artwork, and its animation helpers have been removed. Figma folder silhouettes and grain overlays live in `site/assets/home-v2/`; preserve their source SVG geometry. Menu and phone styles live in `site/menu.css` and `site/home-phone.css`.

At widths of 1100px and above, the homepage hero caps its height at two-thirds of the viewport width while retaining its 720px minimum. This keeps tall desktop windows from separating the width-scaled count from the introductory text. The corner labels scale down with the available width. The narrower layouts retain their existing height rules; the cropped masthead and oversized count are intentional.

Phone folders use `site/folder-motion.ts` to animate measured content and header heights over 820 ms with a symmetric ease-in and ease-out. Rows remain in normal document flow, so neighboring folders and the footer follow the expansion continuously. Contents fade on the same timeline; labels scale without animating font sizes, and arrows turn with the expansion. Labels use their text width so scaling does not create horizontal page overflow.

The heading stays on two lines and scales as one opaque layer on the same timeline as the folders. Its font size remains fixed during motion and at rest, avoiding separate movement phases or a font-size jump at the endpoint. Interrupted motion continues from its current position and scale. The compact heading reserves room for both lines above the instructions.

Each folder clips a fixed-size print during motion so its grain does not stretch on every frame. Quick reversals and switching families start from the current visible heights, opacity, and label sizes. A temporary minimum section height protects the scroll position while the final layout is measured. Scrolling follows the animation only when the opened folder needs more room; wheel or touch input cancels that correction. Reduced motion settles immediately; resizing, hiding the tab, or leaving the page clears animation state. Phone toggles do not rebuild the hidden desktop preview. Check opening, closing, reversals, switching families, lower-folder visibility, and viewport changes when auditing motion. Browser measurements do not establish frame rate on a physical phone.

The family selector uses one ink indicator that stretches between buttons and settles into the selected button's outline. `site/liquid-selection.ts` preserves motion when a new family is selected mid-animation and remeasures after font or viewport changes. A decorative text layer changes label colors where the indicator passes. Drawing stops at rest, and reduced motion selects instantly. This animation is independent of the widget-card transitions.

The generated-file buttons share that liquid indicator, including the overflow file selector. Code changes immediately when a file is chosen; only the highlight moves. The indicator follows the file strip's horizontal scrolling and remeasures when available files or their widths change. Customization switches stretch toward their new position, then return to their original thumb size inside the track. They remain native checkboxes with keyboard support, and reduced motion disables the stretch.

Links between Home, Library, and widget details use the modular print in `site/PageTransition.svelte`. Fifteen rounded modules spread from the activated link and join into full ink coverage. Two oversized copies of the existing WIDGETS masthead move in opposite directions, one green and one paper. Matching windows open through that print to reveal the destination. One full-screen mask is active at a time, with direct vector paths for the green lettering. The bottom destination strip is omitted. The sequence takes about 900 ms, without moving either page. Mobile uses a three-column grid with vertical lettering. Detail navigation starts loading the selected widget during coverage and reuses that request when the route changes. It allows up to 180 ms under full coverage for the widget bundle to load; slower requests use the normal loading notice. Family, sort, and search changes keep their card transitions. Reduced motion, browser history, and browsers without Web Animations navigate immediately. Resize, a hidden tab, or enabling reduced motion clears the overlay. Newer navigation cancels older motion and guards delayed route updates so an old callback cannot restore the wrong page.

## Distribution notices

Vercel Web Analytics is enabled only in Vercel production builds. `site/analytics.ts` records committed page navigation with URL queries and fragments removed; filtering and customization do not produce extra views or events. Local development and preview deployments do not collect analytics. If production counts stay empty, check that Web Analytics is enabled for the project, the injected script loads, and content blockers are not suppressing it. Follow [the analytics setup](publishing.md#web-analytics). The unit suite checks safe page names, query removal, and repeat-view behavior.

Production serves checked static output at [chaldea.vercel.app](https://chaldea.vercel.app). `frontend/scripts/deployment-history.ts` restores retained files from the public `deployment.json`, verifying every byte count and SHA-256 hash. `frontend/scripts/prepare-vercel.ts` combines that history with the newly built site; it refuses conflicting immutable bytes and existing output directories. The history script records the resulting cumulative manifest before deployment. Missing or invalid history stops publication. Follow [publishing.md](publishing.md) for setup, verification, backup recovery, and rollback.

The application uses Apache 2.0; original widgets use 0BSD. Builds emit `LICENSE.txt`, `NOTICE.txt`, and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt`. Keep them with the distributed site. Each widget's output file list includes its applicable license; save it with the other files.

## Family notes

The Sliders family imports Comb, Slats, Stipple Blade, and Weave from the owner's `chaldea assets` folder. Each has a direct browser range control and an independent QML export. Appearance changes preserve the live level; Initial level changes reset it. Exported `value` and `moved(value)` connect to a host model. See [Sliders](../widgets/sliders/README.md) for file layout and native inspection. Live slider previews use the full preview host, with responsive magnification up to 2.5× and a transparent stage background. Their shorter preview panels reduce empty space, including on phones. Width settings continue to control exported dimensions; preview magnification only changes the browser presentation. The family uses 3:1 library plates and SVG thumbnails with outlined lettering. Keep these vector assets when refreshing thumbnails; compressed screenshots soften their small text and fine patterns. Comb and Stipple Blade use complete vector marks instead of cropped repeating backgrounds. Stipple has three rows centered inside its track; marks clear the handle and both track ends. Recompute their geometry only when width or spacing changes. Weave uses a continuous five-pixel lattice and a tall blade over a 30-pixel track. Keep the tile origin at the top of the 36-pixel drawing area, three pixels above the track; shifting it to the track edge changes the weave. Its native lattice stays static while the solid fill and handle move.

Numeric customization inputs must set `min`, `max`, and `step` before `value`. Otherwise a range such as Width can clamp to the browser's default bounds during initialization and show a thumb position that disagrees with the generated settings.

Sea turtle exports a widget-local shared motion engine, vector pigment data, QML components, and compiled Qt shaders. Keep the GLSL sources and their `.qsb` files together; its [README](../widgets/interactive-art/sea-turtle/README.md) gives the shader rebuild commands. Native rendering requires an accelerated Qt Quick backend. Use Qt 6's `qml` and `qmllint` for isolated inspection, since the unqualified commands can still select Qt 5 on some systems. It is included in production builds, with `ARTWORK_NOTICE.txt` retained in the preview bundle and native export.

Each family with native exports keeps its component, shared-file, and inspection notes beside its sources: [Quick notes](../widgets/quick-notes/README.md), [Player](../widgets/player/README.md), [Glyphs](../widgets/glyphs/README.md), [Interactive art](../widgets/interactive-art/README.md), [Lockscreens](../widgets/lockscreens/README.md), and [Sliders](../widgets/sliders/README.md). Lockscreen exports are visual components with demo interactions; the preview launcher does not authenticate or lock the session.

The eight AFK, Editorial, Print, and Reactive lockscreen previews now package their native `assets/GlyphArt.js` as `preview/GlyphArt.js`. Their existing settings keys connect directly to the preview runtime. The unused archive adapter and design selectors are removed; run `make content` after source edits so previews and exports use the same revision.
